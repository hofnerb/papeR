\title{
  Extract and Set Labels from / to Data Frames
}
\description{
  Labels can be stored to an attribute \code{"variable.labels"} using
  the assignment function. With the extractor function one can assess
  these labels. Usually, these labels are generated by
  \code{\link{read.spss}} in package \pkg{foreign}.
}
\usage{

\method{labels}{data.frame}(object, which = NULL, ...)

## assign labels
labels(data, which = NULL) <- value

}

\arguments{
  \item{object}{
    a \code{data.frame}. Usually a result from \code{\link{read.spss}}
    in package \pkg{foreign}.
  }
  \item{data}{
    a \code{data.frame}, where labels should be added or altered.
  }
  \item{which}{
    either a number indicating the label to extract or a character
    string with the variable name for which the label should be
    extracted. One can also use a vector of numerics or character
    strings to extract mutiple labels. If \code{which} is \code{NULL}
    (default), all labels are returned.
  }
  \item{value}{
    a vector containing the labels (in the order of the variables). If
    which is given, only the corresponding subset is labeled. Note that
    all other labels contain the variable name as label afterwards.
  }
  \item{\dots}{
    further options. Currently not applicable.
  }
}
\details{
  %%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
  A named vector of variable labels is returned, where the names are
  the variable names.
}

\note{
  Reordering of the data set does \bold{not} reorder the labels, in
  contrary, the labels are dropped in this case. New labels are always
  attached at the end of the label vector, see examples below.

\examples{
data <- data.frame(a = 1:10, b = 10:1, c = rep(1, 10))
labels(data) <- c("a", "b", "c")
## one gets a named character vector of labels
labels(data)

## set labels for a and b only
labels(data, which = c("a", "b")) <- c("x", "y")
labels(data)

## reset labels:
labels(data) <- NULL
labels(data)

## set label for a only and use default for other labels:
labels(data, which = "a") <- "x"
labels(data)

## attach label for new variable:
data2 <- data
data2$z <- rep(2, 10)
labels(data2)    # no label for z
labels(data2, which = "z") <- "new_label"
labels(data2)
## Note: labels are always attached at the end of the vector

        CHANGES in `papeR' VERSION 0.3-0 (2013-08-02)

  o  preparation of release candidate for CRAN

        CHANGES in `papeR' VERSION 0.2-0 (2013-07-01)

  o  greatly improved prettify functions:
      -  added prettify functions for summary.coxph, summary.lme, summary.mer 
      	 and anova	
      -  added confidence intervals to all model based prettify functions 
         and made confint = TRUE the default;
         confidence intervalls are computed by refitting the model 
         within prettify and using confint() on this model (experimental)
      -  improved handling of p-values

  o  added new class "labeled.data.frame" with special 
     subset, cbind and rbind function (to keep labels when changing data set)

  o  added "shortcut" to define labels using labels = TRUE in latex.tables.XXX:
     labels are extracted from labeled.data.frame directly

  o  new toLatex function for sessionInfo() 
     [with nicer results than the default function from base R: 
      e.g. citations are included]

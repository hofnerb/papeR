        CHANGES in `papeR' VERSION 0.4-0 (2013-09-13, r40)

  o  included (experimental) version of prettify.summary.merMod
     to make lme4 (>= 1.0.0) happy

  o  included better handling of environments in prettify functions
     and checks if the data has changed

  o  included possibility to specify confidence intervals directly
     via confint, e.g.
       prettify(summary(mod), confint = confint(mod))

  o  better handling of NAMESPACES and Imports

  o  added (first) software tests

        CHANGES in `papeR' VERSION 0.3-0 (2013-08-07, r33)

  o  first release to CRAN

  o  improvement/bugfix in rbind.labeled.data.frame()

  o  improvement of toLatex.sessionInfo():
     file can be NULL now (no BibTeX file created on HDD)

  o  added plot function for labeled.data.frame objects that
     allows for univariate plots and grouped, bivariate plots

  o  numerous improvements in manuals

        CHANGES in `papeR' VERSION 0.2-0 (2013-07-01)

  o  greatly improved prettify functions:
      -  added prettify functions for summary.coxph, summary.lme, summary.mer
      	 and anova
      -  added confidence intervals to all model based prettify functions
         and made confint = TRUE the default;
         confidence intervalls are computed by refitting the model
         within prettify and using confint() on this model (experimental)
      -  improved handling of p-values

  o  added new class "labeled.data.frame" with special
     subset, cbind and rbind function (to keep labels when changing data set)

  o  added "shortcut" to define labels using labels = TRUE in latex.tables.XXX:
     labels are extracted from labeled.data.frame directly

  o  new toLatex function for sessionInfo()
     [with nicer results than the default function from base R:
      e.g. citations are included]

        CHANGES in `papeR' VERSION 0.1-0 (2013-01-21)

  o  initial version

  o  improvement of prettify function

  o  added prettify functions for more object classes

  o  added function toLatex to sanitize code for usage in LaTeX

  o  improved label handling when data set is alterd
     (e.g. variables dropped, added or renamed)
